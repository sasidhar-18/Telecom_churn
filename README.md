# Telecom_churn

Churn prediction is a common problem in the telecom industry.
It involves analyzing customer data to identify patterns and factors that indicate a customer is likely to churn in the future.
By predicting churn, telecom companies can take targeted actions, such as offering incentives or personalized marketing campaigns, to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

This repository provides a machine learning model to predict churn in a telecom dataset. The model is trained on historical data containing information about customers, such as demographics, usage patterns, and service subscriptions. It utilizes features such as customer demographics, usage statistics, and service subscription details to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.


## Dataset
